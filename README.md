Analyzing CIA Factbook data - SQL fundamentals project

In this project, I will work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. 
The Factbook contains demographic information like:

population - The population as of 2015.
population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
area - The total land and water area.
In this project, I used SQL to explore and analyze data from this database in Jupyter notebook
